# Black-Jack-Game
The game of black jack or what some know it as 21 holds a special place in my heart. 
Growing up it was the first card game my grandfather taught us to play as it taught us 
simple math skills and the concept of statistics. 

The Objective of the game is to draw cards that are equivilent to 21 or to reach closer to 21 before the dealer and with out going over 21.

the way to use the game is you must press the button HIT ME to deal cards to you the player. then once you have been dealt the cards you are comfortable "standing" with you presss STAND and then cards are dealt to the dealer. Then you will find out who is the winner, loser or if there is a draw.
